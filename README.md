Problems of Vehicle Routing are known in mathematics as NP hard. The time required to solve such problems is an exponential function of the number of locations and is a popular area of research in the industry.
In this study, attempt is made to solve one type of VRP known as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) in which a fleet of identical vehicles with limited capacity, located at a central depot must be optimally routed to supply a set of customers with known demands. 
The goal is to optimize the last mile delivery process by calculating optimum delivery routes and minimizing the transportation costs while ensuring minimum number of stockouts.
